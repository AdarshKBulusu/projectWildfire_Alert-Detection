# Wildfire-Alert-Detection

## Required Material

1. Raspberry Pi(s) 3x
2. Flame Sensor (for raspberry pi)
3. gpio pin config 
4. raspberry pi(s) must share same network

After using the instructions from the raspberry-pi-instructions.txt to ssh into the Raspberry Pi's. Then run the code through the raspberry pi(s) and simulate 
a fire and test the speed of the connection and message. 

Work in progress more code needs to be added to ensure messages are queued and recieved in proper time. There will also be an analytic system to determine why messages
are getting bottlenecked.
